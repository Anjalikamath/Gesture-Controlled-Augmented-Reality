Download and unzip (7-Zip) the folder to access the code.

The following are the code execution steps:

* Unzip the folder.<br>
* Build and run the unity application on an Android (5.x and/or later) smartphone.<br>
* Open 2 tabs on a browser on the remote PC.<br>
* Run the gesture recognition pc_controller.py code on the host pc.<br>
* Once the application is up and running, use gestures in the AR app to control the browser.<br>
